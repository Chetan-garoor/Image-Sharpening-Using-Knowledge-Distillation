# Image-Sharpening-Using-Knowledge-Distillation
This project tackles blurry images from motion, defocus, or low resolution in real-time apps like video calls or surveillance. It uses knowledge distillation to train a lightweight student model that mimics a powerful teacher model, enabling sharp, high-quality image restoration with low computational cost on edge devices.
